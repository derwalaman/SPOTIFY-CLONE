# Music Controller (Spotify Clone)

Welcome to the Music Controller project! This project is a Spotify-like music controller built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It mimics some of the core functionalities of Spotify, allowing users to play music, control playback, and view playlists.

Live Preview Link : [Spotify-Clone](https://decoratora.in/spotify-clone/) : I have used a lite server , so it might take some time to load the images and audio files.
